Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. A clean, uncluttered interface helps users focus on what matters most. Remove unnecessary elements and focus on core functionality.

## 2. Consistency is Key

Maintain consistent design patterns, colors, and typography throughout your application. Users should feel familiar with your interface as they navigate.

## 3. Make It Accessible

Ensure your design works for users with disabilities by following accessibility guidelines. Use proper contrast ratios, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation.

## 4. Provide Clear Feedback

Users should always know what's happening when they interact with your interface. Show loading states, success messages, and error notifications.

## 5. Design for Mobile First

With mobile usage continuing to grow, designing for mobile first ensures a better experience across all devices.

## 6. Use Visual Hierarchy

Guide users through your content with proper visual hierarchy. Use size, color, and spacing to indicate importance.

## 7. Minimize Cognitive Load

Don't make users think too hard. Use familiar patterns, clear labels, and logical groupings.

## 8. Test with Real Users

No amount of theory can replace actual user testing. Observe how real users interact with your design.

## 9. Embrace White Space

White space isn't wasted space. It helps create focus, improves readability, and makes interfaces feel less cluttered.

## 10. Stay Updated

Design trends and user expectations evolve. Stay current with design patterns and emerging technologies.`,

    title: "Understanding React Server Components",
    slug: "react-server-components",
    content: `React Server Components represent a paradigm shift in how we build React applications. This article explores how they work, their benefits, and practical use cases.

## What are Server Components?

Server Components are a new type of React component that runs on the server instead of the client. They allow you to build components that:

- Render on the server during the request
- Have direct access to backend resources like databases
- Don't add to the client-side JavaScript bundle
- Can be seamlessly mixed with client components

## Key Benefits

### Performance Improvements
- **Reduced bundle size**: Server components don't ship JavaScript to the client
- **Faster initial page loads**: HTML is generated on the server
- **Better Core Web Vitals**: Improved LCP, FID, and CLS scores

### Developer Experience
- **Direct database access**: No need for API routes for simple data fetching
- **Simplified data fetching**: Async/await directly in components
- **Better SEO**: Content is server-rendered by default

### Security
- **Sensitive operations stay on server**: API keys and database credentials never reach the client
- **Reduced attack surface**: Less client-side code means fewer potential vulnerabilities

## When to Use Server Components

Server Components are ideal for:
- **Static content rendering**: Headers, footers, navigation
- **Data-heavy components**: Product listings, user profiles
- **SEO-critical pages**: Blog posts, marketing pages
- **Components without interactivity**: Display-only components

## When to Use Client Components

Client Components are necessary for:
- **Interactive elements**: Forms, buttons with onClick handlers
- **Browser APIs**: localStorage, geolocation, camera access
- **State management**: useState, useReducer, context
- **Real-time features**: WebSocket connections, live updates

## Implementation Example

Here's a simple example of how Server and Client Components work together:

**Server Component (runs on server):**
\`\`\`jsx
// This runs on the server
async function BlogPost({ id }) {
  const post = await fetchPostFromDatabase(id);
  
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
      <LikeButton postId={id} initialLikes={post.likes} />
    </article>
  );
}
\`\`\`

**Client Component (runs on client):**
\`\`\`jsx
'use client';

function LikeButton({ postId, initialLikes }) {
  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(initialLikes);
  
  const handleLike = () => {
    setLikes(likes + 1);
    // Send like to server
  };
  
  return (
    <button onClick={handleLike}>
      ❤️ {likes}
    </button>
  );
}
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Server Components**: Use Server Components by default and only add 'use client' when needed
2. **Minimize Client Components**: Keep interactive parts small and focused
3. **Compose thoughtfully**: Server Components can render Client Components, but not vice versa
4. **Handle loading states**: Use Suspense boundaries for better user experience

## The Future of React

Server Components represent the future direction of React development, enabling better performance, developer experience, and user experience. As the ecosystem matures, we can expect to see more tools and patterns emerge around this paradigm.`,

    title: "Optimizing Website Performance: A Developer's Guide",
    slug: "website-performance-optimization",
    content: `Website performance directly impacts user experience, conversion rates, and search engine rankings. This comprehensive guide covers practical techniques for creating lightning-fast web experiences.

## Why Performance Matters

The statistics are clear:
- **53% of users abandon sites** that take longer than 3 seconds to load
- **1-second delay can reduce conversions by 7%**
- **Google uses page speed as a ranking factor** for search results
- **Slow sites cost businesses millions** in lost revenue annually

## Core Web Vitals

Google's Core Web Vitals are essential metrics for measuring user experience:

### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- **Target**: Under 2.5 seconds
- **What it measures**: Time to render the largest content element
- **How to improve**: Optimize images, improve server response times, eliminate render-blocking resources

### First Input Delay (FID)
- **Target**: Under 100 milliseconds
- **What it measures**: Time from first user interaction to browser response
- **How to improve**: Reduce JavaScript execution time, use web workers, optimize third-party scripts

### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- **Target**: Under 0.1
- **What it measures**: Visual stability of the page
- **How to improve**: Reserve space for dynamic content, use proper image dimensions, avoid inserting content above existing content

## Image Optimization

Images often account for the majority of a page's weight:

### Modern Formats
- **WebP**: 25-35% smaller than JPEG with similar quality
- **AVIF**: Even better compression than WebP
- **Use picture element** for format fallbacks

### Responsive Images
- **srcset attribute**: Serve different sizes for different screen densities
- **sizes attribute**: Tell the browser which image size to use
- **Lazy loading**: Load images only when they're about to enter the viewport

### Implementation Example
\`\`\`html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.avif" type="image/avif">
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" loading="lazy">
</picture>
\`\`\`

## JavaScript Optimization

### Code Splitting
Break your JavaScript into smaller chunks:
- **Route-based splitting**: Load code for each page separately
- **Component-based splitting**: Load components only when needed
- **Dynamic imports**: Load modules on demand

### Tree Shaking
Remove unused code from your bundles:
- Use ES6 modules for better tree shaking
- Configure your bundler properly
- Avoid importing entire libraries when you only need specific functions

### Bundle Analysis
Regularly analyze your bundles:
- Use webpack-bundle-analyzer or similar tools
- Identify large dependencies
- Look for duplicate code across chunks

## CSS Optimization

### Critical CSS
- **Inline critical CSS**: Include above-the-fold styles in the HTML
- **Defer non-critical CSS**: Load remaining styles asynchronously
- **Remove unused CSS**: Use tools like PurgeCSS to eliminate dead code

### CSS Loading Strategy
\`\`\`html
<!-- Critical CSS inlined -->
<style>
  /* Critical styles here */
</style>

<!-- Non-critical CSS loaded asynchronously -->
<link rel="preload" href="styles.css" as="style" onload="this.onload=null;this.rel='stylesheet'">
\`\`\`

## Server-Side Optimization

### Caching Strategies
- **Browser caching**: Set appropriate cache headers
- **CDN caching**: Use a Content Delivery Network
- **Server-side caching**: Cache database queries and API responses

### Compression
- **Gzip/Brotli**: Compress text-based resources
- **Image compression**: Optimize images without losing quality
- **Minification**: Remove unnecessary characters from code

### HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
- **Multiplexing**: Send multiple requests simultaneously
- **Server Push**: Send resources before they're requested
- **Header compression**: Reduce overhead of HTTP headers

## Monitoring and Measurement

### Performance Monitoring Tools
- **Google PageSpeed Insights**: Analyze performance and get recommendations
- **WebPageTest**: Detailed performance analysis
- **Lighthouse**: Comprehensive auditing tool
- **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**: Track actual user experiences

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**: Server response time
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: When first content appears
- **Speed Index**: How quickly content is visually populated
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**: Time when main thread is blocked

## Advanced Techniques

### Service Workers
- **Caching strategies**: Cache resources for offline access
- **Background sync**: Sync data when connection is restored
- **Push notifications**: Engage users even when site isn't open

### Preloading and Prefetching
- **Preload**: Load critical resources early
- **Prefetch**: Load resources for future navigation
- **DNS prefetch**: Resolve domain names early

### Resource Hints
\`\`\`html
<!-- Preload critical resources -->
<link rel="preload" href="font.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>

<!-- Prefetch resources for next page -->
<link rel="prefetch" href="next-page.html">

<!-- DNS prefetch for external domains -->
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="//external-api.com">
\`\`\`

## Performance Budget

Set and maintain performance budgets:
- **Size budgets**: Maximum file sizes for different resource types
- **Timing budgets**: Maximum load times for key metrics
- **Quantity budgets**: Maximum number of requests
- **Automated enforcement**: Fail builds that exceed budgets

## Testing and Optimization Workflow

1. **Establish baseline**: Measure current performance
2. **Set goals**: Define target metrics
3. **Implement optimizations**: Apply techniques systematically
4. **Measure impact**: Verify improvements
5. **Monitor continuously**: Track performance over time
6. **Iterate**: Continuously improve based on data

## Common Performance Pitfalls

### Third-Party Scripts
- **Analytics**: Can significantly impact performance
- **Social media widgets**: Often poorly optimized
- **Advertising**: Can add substantial overhead
- **Solution**: Load third-party scripts asynchronously and monitor their impact

### Over-Optimization
- **Premature optimization**: Focus on biggest impact first
- **Micro-optimizations**: Don't sacrifice maintainability for minimal gains
- **User experience**: Performance is means to better UX, not an end in itself

## Conclusion

Website performance optimization is an ongoing process that requires attention to multiple aspects of web development. By focusing on Core Web Vitals, optimizing images and code, implementing proper caching strategies, and continuously monitoring performance, you can create fast, engaging web experiences that delight users and drive business results.

Remember: **Performance is a feature**, not an afterthought. Build it into your development process from the beginning, and your users will thank you for it.`,

## Semantic HTML: The Foundation

### Proper Heading Structure
\`\`\`html
<h1>Main Page Title</h1>
  <h2>Section Title</h2>
    <h3>Subsection Title</h3>
    <h3>Another Subsection</h3>
  <h2>Another Section</h2>
\`\`\`

### Landmark Elements
\`\`\`html
<header>
  <nav aria-label="Main navigation">
    <!-- Navigation content -->
  </nav>
</header>

<main>
  <article>
    <h1>Article Title</h1>
    <!-- Article content -->
  </article>
  
  <aside>
    <!-- Sidebar content -->
  </aside>
</main>

<footer>
  <!-- Footer content -->
</footer>
\`\`\`

### Form Accessibility
\`\`\`html
<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Personal Information</legend>
    
    <label for="name">Full Name (required)</label>

<button aria-pressed="false">Toggle Button</button>
<div aria-hidden="true">Decorative content</div>
\`\`\`

### ARIA States
Describe current conditions:
\`\`\`html
<button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="menu">Menu</button>
<input aria-invalid="true" aria-describedby="error-msg">
<div aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true">Status updates</div>
\`\`\`

## Common Accessibility Patterns

### Skip Links
\`\`\`html
<a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>
<!-- Other navigation -->
<main id="main-content">
  <!-- Main content -->
</main>
\`\`\`

### Focus Management
\`\`\`javascript
// When opening a modal
function openModal() {
  const modal = document.getElementById('modal');
  const firstFocusable = modal.querySelector('button, input, select, textarea, [tabindex]:not([tabindex="-1"])');
  
  modal.style.display = 'block';
  firstFocusable.focus();
  
  // Trap focus within modal
  modal.addEventListener('keydown', trapFocus);
}

function trapFocus(e) {
  if (e.key === 'Tab') {
    const focusableElements = modal.querySelectorAll('button, input, select, textarea, [tabindex]:not([tabindex="-1"])');
    const firstElement = focusableElements[0];
    const lastElement = focusableElements[focusableElements.length - 1];
    
    if (e.shiftKey && document.activeElement === firstElement) {
      e.preventDefault();
      lastElement.focus();
    } else if (!e.shiftKey && document.activeElement === lastElement) {
      e.preventDefault();
      firstElement.focus();
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Live Regions
\`\`\`html
<!-- For status messages -->
<div aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true" class="sr-only" id="status"></div>

<!-- For urgent alerts -->
<div aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true" class="sr-only" id="alerts"></div>
\`\`\`

\`\`\`javascript
// Announce status updates
function announceStatus(message) {
  const statusElement = document.getElementById('status');
  statusElement.textContent = message;
}
\`\`\`

\`\`\`jsx
// Use semantic HTML
function Navigation() {
  return (
    <nav aria-label="Main navigation">
      <ul>
        {menuItems.map(item => (
          <li key={item.id}>
            <Link to={item.path} aria-current={isActive ? 'page' : undefined}>
              {item.label}
            </Link>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </nav>
  );
}

// Manage focus
function Modal({ isOpen, onClose, children }) {
  const modalRef = useRef();
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isOpen) {
      const firstFocusable = modalRef.current.querySelector('[tabindex], button, input, select, textarea');
      firstFocusable?.focus();
    }
  }, [isOpen]);
  
  return isOpen ? (
    <div role="dialog" aria-modal="true" ref={modalRef}>
      <button onClick={onClose} aria-label="Close modal">×</button>
      {children}
    </div>
  ) : null;
}
\`\`\`

### Vue.js Accessibility
\`\`\`vue
